&lt;p>So many things to decide for this blog moving forward. I guess we could call it
determining normalcy. First of all, school is so boring. How I miss doing the
multiple weekly essays for history, now all I have is a discussion or two a week
on the bible. I am not a religious person, and I am not sure why this is a
necessary for a university student to take it, but thankfully this is the last
general education class I will have to take for this major. I am so tired.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Blog Post</title><link>https://anair14.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:26:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://anair14.github.io/blog/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="what-to-say">What to say&lt;/h3>

I love the idea of this blog. A vast expanse where only my thoughts can swim.
I am struggling with mental health now, but I am sure it will pass. It always
passes. I can only focus on Simba, and the other few fully positive things in
my life. I also have to focus on school, job hunting, and moving into the new
house next week. I am currently 3 months into my journey of praying everyday,
and there have only been a few slip ups.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
