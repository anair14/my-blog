I love the idea of this blog. A vast expanse where only my thoughts can swim.
I am struggling with mental health now, but I am sure it will pass. It always
passes. I can only focus on Simba, and the other few fully positive things in
my life. I also have to focus on school, job hunting, and moving into the new
house next week. I am currently 3 months into my journey of praying everyday,
and there have only been a few slip ups.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
