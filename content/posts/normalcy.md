What are we doing here?

So many things to decide for this blog moving forward. I guess we could call it
determining normalcy. First of all, school is so boring. How I miss doing the
multiple weekly essays for history, now all I have is a discussion or two a week
on the bible. I am not a religious person, and I am not sure why this is a 
necessary for a university student to take it, but thankfully this is the last
general education class I will have to take for this major. I am so tired.

I say that I am tired quite often, and am sure that I am probably just a broken
record at  this point. I am unfortunately just drained completely. I do not know
what to say from here. Maybe I will update this later.

Finished working on my schoolwork today. Not sure what to do next. My options are:

1.  Coding
2.  Schoolwork
3.  OMS Work

Dad came home early today, and I heard him arguing on the phone with his family
back home. That is a story for a very different time. Regardless, we are
moving forward in life, and trying to focus on things that won't make me assume
the fetal position and sleep for 20 hours.

I had a meeting with my academic counselor today. It seems that some of the few
classes I had left to take are not offered online anymore. How is this even
possible? How can they shut down multiple courses when people are currently
enrolled in them, and need them to graduate. Thankfully, There are some 
alternatives. I guess this is just another roadblock. You have to wonder though,
when do these roadblocks end?


# When does the road end?
