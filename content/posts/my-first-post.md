### What to say

![alttext](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pjPZ4vUPQ20/UUCL5Owu-5I/AAAAAAAAMRE/hdk_hqU2Qxw/%25255BMax7%25255DTrigunMaxVol10Ch7-24%25252625.jpg?imgmax=2000)
I love the idea of this blog. A vast expanse where only my thoughts can swim.
I am struggling with mental health now, but I am sure it will pass. It always
passes. I can only focus on Simba, and the other few fully positive things in
my life. I also have to focus on school, job hunting, and moving into the new
house next week. I am currently 3 months into my journey of praying everyday,
and there have only been a few slip ups.
